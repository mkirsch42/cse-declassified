# About this Site

Having worked as a software engineer through my whole college career, I have the privilege of being able to compare what I learn in my college courses to the skills I actually employ in my job. The major discrepency I've noticed is that while my college courses at UCONN have focused almost solely on technical knowledge, at no point did they really teach skills such as version control, workflows, how to think like a programmer, etc etc. I've seen through teaching many of my friends that UCONN frankly does a pretty terrible job of preparing students to be software engineers in the real world, and I'm assuming many other colleges are similar in this regard.

My hope for this blog is to gradually compile all of the lessons, tips, and tricks that I've found to actually be important in the job market. Don't expect too much information about syntax, data structures, etc. here, since college courses more or less do a fine job of teaching that skill. I don't have any sort of schedule or plan for posting; new articles will come out when I get the inspiration to share something. If you want me to cover a specific topic, feel free to email me at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
